drf-spectacular
===============

*Sane and flexible OpenAPI 3 schema generation for Django REST framework.*

Documentation is an integral part of API development and OpenAPI 3 is finally here
to make that process easier. By using `drf-spectacular <https://github.com/tfranzel/drf-spectacular>`_
with `Django REST Framework (DRF) <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`_,
your schema and therefore your documentation & client will always stay close to your API.

drf-spectacular works well out of the box, but also provides you with several easy ways
to customize the generated OpenAPI 3 schema. It is explicitly designed to work well for
documentation (`SwaggerUI <https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui>`_, `ReDoc <https://github.com/Redocly/redoc>`_)
and automatic `client generation <https://openapi-generator.tech>`_.
