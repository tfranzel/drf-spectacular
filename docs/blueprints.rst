Extension Blueprints
====================

Blueprints are a collection of schema fixes for Django and REST Framework apps.
Some libraries/apps do not play well with *drf-spectacular*'s automatic introspection.
With extensions you can manually provide the necessary information to generate a better schema.

There is no blueprint for the app you are looking for? No problem, you can easily write extensions
yourself. Take the blueprints here as examples and have a look at :ref:`customization`.
Feel free to contribute new ones or fixes with a `PR <https://github.com/tfranzel/drf-spectacular/pulls>`_.
Blueprint files can be found `here <https://github.com/tfranzel/drf-spectacular/tree/master/docs/blueprints>`_.

.. note:: Simply copy&paste the snippets into your codebase. The extensions register
  themselves automatically. Just be sure that the python interpreter sees them at least once.
  It is good practice to collect your extensions in ``YOUR_MAIN_APP_NAME/schema.py`` and importing that
  file in your ``YOUR_MAIN_APP_NAME/apps.py``. Every proper Django app will already have an auto-generated
  ``apps.py`` file. Although not strictly necessary, doing the import in ``ready()`` is the most robust
  approach. It will make sure your environment (e.g. settings) is properly set up prior to loading.

.. code-block:: python

    # your_main_app_name/apps.py
    class YourMainAppNameConfig(AppConfig):
        default_auto_field = "django.db.models.BigAutoField"
        name = "your_main_app_name"

        def ready(self):
            import your_main_app_name.schema  # noqa: E402

dj-stripe
---------

Stripe Models for Django: `dj-stripe <https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe>`_

.. literalinclude:: blueprints/djstripe.py


django-oscar-api
----------------

RESTful API for django-oscar: `django-oscar-api <https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar-api>`_

.. literalinclude:: blueprints/oscarapi.py


djangorestframework-api-key
---------------------------

Since `djangorestframework-api-key <https://github.com/florimondmanca/djangorestframework-api-key>`_ has
no entry in ``authentication_classes``, *drf-spectacular* cannot pick up this library. To alleviate
this shortcoming, you can manually add the appropriate security scheme.

.. note:: Usage of the ``SECURITY`` setting is discouraged, unless there are special circumstances
  like here for example. For almost all cases ``OpenApiAuthenticationExtension`` is strongly preferred,
  because ``SECURITY`` will get appended to every endpoint in the schema regardless of effectiveness.

.. code:: python

    SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS = {
        "APPEND_COMPONENTS": {
            "securitySchemes": {
                "ApiKeyAuth": {
                    "type": "apiKey",
                    "in": "header",
                    "name": "Authorization"
                }
            }
        },
        "SECURITY": [{"ApiKeyAuth": [], }],
         ...
    }


Polymorphic models
------------------

Using polymorphic models/serializers unfortunately yields flat serializers due to the way
the serializers are constructed. This means the polymorphic serializers have no inheritance
hierarchy that represents common functionality. These extensions retroactively build a
hierarchy by rolling up the "common denominator" fields into the base components, and
importing those into the sub-components via ``allOf``. This results in components that better
represent the structure of the underlying serializers/models from which they originated.

The components work perfectly fine without this extension, but in some cases generated
client code has a hard time with the disjunctive nature of the unmodified components.
This blueprint is designed to fix that issue.

RapiDoc
-------

`RapiDoc`__ is documentation tool that can be used as an alternate to Redoc or Swagger UI.

__ https://mrin9.github.io/RapiDoc/

.. literalinclude:: blueprints/rapidoc.py

.. literalinclude:: blueprints/rapidoc.html

Elements
--------

`Elements`__ is another documentation tool that can be used as an alternate to Redoc or Swagger UI.

drf-rw-serializers
------------------

`drf-rw-serializers`__ provides generic views, viewsets and mixins that extend the Django REST
Framework ones adding separated serializers for read and write operations.

*drf-spectacular* requires just a small ``AutoSchema`` augmentation to make it aware of
``drf-rw-serializers``. Remember to replace the ``AutoSchema`` in ``DEFAULT_SCHEMA_CLASS``.

.. literalinclude:: blueprints/drf_rw_serializers.py

drf-extra-fields Base64FileField
--------------------------------

`drf-extra-fields`__ provides a ``Base64FileField`` and ``Base64ImageField`` that automatically
represent binary files as base64 encoded strings. This is a useful way to embed files within a
larger JSON API and keep all data within the same tree and served with a single request or
response.

Because requests to these fields require a base64 encoded string and responses can be either a
URI or base64 contents (if ``represent_as_base64=True``) custom schema generation
logic is required as this differs from the default DRF ``FileField``.

django-auth-adfs
----------------

`django-auth-adfs <https://github.com/snok/django-auth-adfs>`_ provides "a Django authentication backend for Microsoft ADFS and Azure AD".
The blueprint works for the Azure AD configuration guide (see: https://django-auth-adfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/azure_ad_config_guide.html).

.. literalinclude:: blueprints/django_auth_adfs.py


django-parler-rest
------------------

`django-parler-rest <https://github.com/django-parler/django-parler-rest>`_ integration for
translation package `django-parler <https://github.com/django-parler/django-parler>`_.

.. literalinclude:: blueprints/django_parler_rest.py


Pydantic
--------

Preliminary support for `Pydantic <https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic>`_  models.
Catches decorated Pydantic classes and integrates their schema.

Pydantic 2 is now officially supported without any manual steps.

Pydantic 1:

.. literalinclude:: blueprints/pydantic.py


msgspec
-------

Basic support for `msgspec <https://github.com/jcrist/msgspec>`_ models.

This blueprint allows the use of `@extend_schema` with base classes of type `msgspec.Struct` 
or a type annotation of `list[msgspec.Struct]` and generates a corresponding schema.
